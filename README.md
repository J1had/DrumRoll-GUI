# DrumRoll-GUI
A GUI that controls the hardware element of the project.

Hello There!
=========================
This Project is a GUI application which is designed to communicate with the hardware aspect of this project.

It’s in its very early stages and the graphical components still need work, but can be improved in the future.

Features
=========================
I wanted to have minimal features as to not push myself into areas that I was incapable of doing. So I stuck to simple mechanics such as buttons and sliders.

Rotary Sliders to control speed and pattern control
Buttons to navigate to different windows(WIP) and play and stop buttons

I do plan on adding images and animations to make the front end more eye catching, Cause now that I have a basic prototype done I can now build upon it and make tweaks to make it better.

Bugs & Limits
=========================
Like many prototypes theres always bugs. I’ve encountered pleanty of bugs from which I have fixed and now have turned to errors. 

Main problems I had was trying to communicate with an Arduino via the serial port, I think trying to communicate with midi instead would be a lot easier and faster than trying to deal with a silent serial port.
